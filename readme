This is the assessment for Mpumelelo Ngema.

In order to execute this assessment you will need to go
to java class HtmlReader.java which has a main method that
consumes the html URL and then read the table content and take
print out the technologies per stack via JSON string.

There is a utility class called JacksonUtil.java which converts the
input Object variable into JSON via Jackson, there are 2 methods on this
utility class, they both to the same thing which is to convert the Object
but one has a pretty printer which displays the technologyStack JSON nicely.
For testing purposed I'm using the non pretty printer as there is issues with
environment when doing testing it as you will get "content have differences only
in line separators" even though the expected and actual is the same.
